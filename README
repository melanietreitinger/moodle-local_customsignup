local_customsignup
==================

Requirements
------------

This pugin requires Moodle 3.9+


Motivation for this theme
-------------------------
With this plugin we can define custom fields for the registration form which are created as "User profile fields" **and** can be defined as "required" *only* for the registration process.


Usage & Settings
----------------
This plugin uses a hook in login/signup_form.php: core_login_extend_signup_form() in order to add additional fields to the signup form.
These fields are automatically created as "User profile fields" during installation and populated when a user signs up via email registration.

The fields are:

- confirmname: Users have to use their real name.
- regreason: Users have to enter a reason for the account creation.

Both fields can be activated and declared as required in admin settings.


Note
----
The language of the database entrief of the "User profile fields" is defined by the language during the installation of the plugin.
This is not crucial because the language of the fields and options in the registration form is defined by the Moodle language settings the user has made.


Uninstall
---------
The "User profile fields" are **not** deleted during uninstall.
Though they are recognized when you re-install the plugin.
