==================

Requirements
------------

This pugin requires Moodle 3.9+
If you have more languages than English installed, please activate the "Multi-Language Content" filter with setting "Content and headings".


Motivation for this plugin
-------------------------
With this plugin we can define custom fields for the registration form which are created as "User profile fields" **and** can be defined as "required" *only* for the registration process.


Usage & Settings
----------------
This plugin uses a hook in login/signup_form.php: core_login_extend_signup_form() in order to add additional fields to the signup form.
These fields are automatically created as "User profile fields" during installation and populated when a user signs up via email registration.

The fields are:

- confirmname: Users have to use their real name.
- regreason: Users have to enter a reason for the account creation.

Both fields can be activated and declared as "required" in admin settings.


Note
----
The options for the select menu of the "User profile fields" "regreason" are created with multilang tags, so the "Multi-Language Content" filter with setting "Content and headings" is needed.


Uninstall
---------
The "User profile fields" are **not** deleted during uninstall.
They are recognized when you re-install the plugin.
